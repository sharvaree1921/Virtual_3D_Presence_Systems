# Virtual_3D_Presence_Systems
## Winter Intern 2020

### Week 1: 03/12/2020 to 06/12/2020
### 1. What are 3D Holograms?
A 3D hologram is defined as a 3D projection that exists freely in space and is visible to everyone without the need for 3D glasses. Holography is the next stage of photography and conventional film and its three-dimensionality creates completely new possibilities for use, such as for product presentation.

### 2. How 3D Holograms work?
Laser light is much purer than the ordinary light in a flashlight (torch) beam. In a flashlight beam, all the light waves are random and jumbled up. Light in a flashlight beam runs along any old how, like schoolchildren racing down a corridor when the bell goes for home time. But in a laser, the light waves are coherent: they all travel precisely in step, like soldiers marching on parade.

When a laser beam is split up to make a hologram, the light waves in the two parts of the beam are traveling in identical ways. When they recombine in the photographic plate, the object beam has traveled via a slightly different path and its light rays have been disturbed by reflecting off the outer surface of the object. Since the beams were originally joined together and perfectly in step, recombining the beams shows how the light rays in the object beam have been changed compared to the reference beam. In other words, by joining the two beams back together and comparing them, you can see how the object changes light rays falling onto it—and that's simply another way of saying "what the object looks like." This information is burned permanently into the photographic plate by the laser beams. So a hologram is effectively a permanent record of what something looks like seen from any angle.

Now this is the clever part. Every point in a hologram catches light waves that travel from every point in the object. That means wherever you look at a hologram you see exactly how light would have arrived at that point if you'd been looking at the real object. So, as you move your head around, the holographic image appears to change just as the image of a real object changes. And that's why holograms appear to be three-dimensional. Also, and this is really neat, if you break a hologram into tiny pieces, you can still see the entire object in any of the pieces: smash a glass hologram of a cup into bits and you can still see the entire cup in any of the bits!

### Week 2: 07/12/2020
## Prototyping Various Methods:

### Method A1] Pyramidal CD case/glass model:

Click here for [photos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MA1DFaRJWMje8MAwpLCMn1QLM8kbAhp8hHpC4f_xl5U/edit)

Video or short demo can be found [here](https://photos.google.com/direct/AF1QipN7hyMwt5H9zQnU16_XEbcTjZz88tUTHqZScBdRoxIZKa_lpV1tGXt1msKxOQqnJw/photo/AF1QipOIYdlCYoYWgIeAYKVuJ7e8jaavoP0S6e09bsT2)]

#### Observations:
1] Clarity is much better in glass than CD case or acrylic sheet
2] The base of the pyramid should be accurately flat and edges should be alligned properly to see proper interference pattern
3] Irrespective of sizes of pyramids, the size of Hologram is constant(Nearly 1/2 inch)
4] Size of 3D hologram is directly proportional to the original image/video (if some bigger screen is taken, then 3D hologram size also increases)
5] Best optimum size results found in middle sized glass hologram(comparing with the other models)

Some Remarks about Other methods:
1] Epoxy resin + Hardener order placed [here](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07MV9G6NC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - Resin: Hardener = 2:1 or 3:1
  - 'Super Clear transperant'/'High Definition Resin' required
  - proper weiging scale + beaker + stirrer required(still finding possible ways to perform this)
  
 2] Smoke generated 3D hologram with:

 A] Smoke generation machine(costs Rs.4000+ excluding other materials)
 B] Fogg/Water Vapour machine(costs 2000+ excluding other materials)
 C] Incense stick(in search of projector and good setup)
 
 3] Fast moving Fan technology
 Not possible at home, high end technology mentioned
 
 4] Liquid Nitrogen method(not sure:out of scope)
 
 5] Laser Mirror split(out of scope)
 
 6] Mounting CD case at some angle(2D hologram)

### Questions to be addressed:

1] Video played/image project: different or symmetrical?

2] how to make it clear(static assymmetrical image):

- Effect of HD/diff resolutions,
- Effect of monochrome/RGB/colour,
- Effect of brightness(%), 
- Effect of size,etc.
- (Take gradations: give ratings)

3] Environment changes(black room or light room): Day time

4] Refractive indices of glass, acrylic sheets, epoxy resin

5] What happens when we look 3D hologram from above? 

Next Stage:
Creating an image itself for symmetrical or assymmetrical objects

### Week 3: 13/12/2020 to 20/12/2020

#### Previous Experiments:

[video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kt-lUhhUJb1e8Q03nK3cxunmJ863DoL6/view?usp=sharing)

All photos regarding incense stick and steam generator machine are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MA1DFaRJWMje8MAwpLCMn1QLM8kbAhp8hHpC4f_xl5U/edit)

_Hitachi LCD Projector was used for projection_

**Schematics:**

![images](https://github.com/sharvaree1921/Photos_for_repo/blob/master/1608649456688.jpg)

**Observations**
- The 3D hologram is very blur in both the cases. Hardly it can be seen.
- Comparitively, steam generated 3D hologram was more clearer than smoke generated 3D hologram
- Keeping black background benifitted in seeing the hologram more clearly than any other background
- In both the cases, entire clear hologram was visible. Only half of it was visible and that through only a particular angle
- We have to see straight in the line of projector in order to see it clearly
- Be very careful while dealing with incense sticks, they might be dangerous as we are lighting them all at once
- The entire setup is space and time taking
- Not at all cost efficient model with very poor quality

**Epoxy Resin Pyramid experiment still in progress**

**_Some Side remarks(experiences that i had while performing this experiment):_**
- Epoxy resin behaves entirely different when mixed _by volume_ and when mixed _by weight_.
- For this particular experiment, epoxy resin is to be used **by weight** and 3:1/2:1/1:1 any ratio would do(I used 3:1 ratio)
- The glass/acrylic sheet material pyramid has to be made accurately so that one can see the proper interference pattern otherwise the epoxy-resin solution may leak(unfortunately this happened with me inspite of using silicon and bond-tite hardware based special superglues)
- Be very careful while mixing solution. Prevent bubbles and yellowish texture from coming in the solution
- Epoxy resin takes 24 hours to dry, hence plan accordingly 

**Some Previous Questions that needed to be addressed along with some extra observations and conclusions that I made:**

#### For pyramid experiment:

1] Incresing the size of input object(i.e. images) increased the size of hologram.
- However, the size of the pyramid used also matters. Increase the size of pyramid in proportionate manner.
- The distnce of object from four sides is important to consider. More the distance, more far(greater in heights) is the hologram formed inside the pyramid.

2] What happens when we look hologram from above?
- The hologram is not at all seen from above. It is only seen from side views.

3] How can the 3D hologram be seen in daytime/ without using dark room?
- In order to see the clear 3D _reflection_ hologram in daytime, intense spot lights or illumination light is required like **Laser**. Basically we need 'directional' and coherent light source for clearer outputs. As we increase the background light as we move from dark room to illuminated room, more and more noise is added, which makes the rays coming from input images/objects less 'directional' and less ' single source illuminated'.
(Still researching on this topic for improvement of our model)

4] What's the nature of image/video frames when we project it?

**Static Image:**

The opposite images are placed in the 180 degrees flipped fashion in front of each other such that one end is diameterically opposite to the other at an equal distance.

The image can be symmetrical or assymetrical. It doesn't matter what our image is but it does matter how our images are placed on four sides.

Observation: Complete 3D hologram is seen as only a particular object is seen with black background.

![image 2](https://github.com/sharvaree1921/Photos_for_repo/blob/master/WhatsApp%20Image%202020-12-20%20at%2010.23.44%20AM.jpeg)

Observation: 3D Holographic frames from all 4 sides are seen as the images are rectangular in shape. No exact 3D object is seen in the middle.

When a single object with black bckground is kept:

![image 3](https://github.com/sharvaree1921/Photos_for_repo/blob/master/WhatsApp%20Image%202020-12-20%20at%2010.43.32%20AM.jpeg)

Observation: The 3D object is clearly seen with mirror image of the original one

To see exactly, how it works, i took a word as our inout object

![image 4](https://github.com/sharvaree1921/Photos_for_repo/blob/master/WhatsApp%20Image%202020-12-20%20at%2010.52.38%20AM.jpeg)

Obseration: Mirror image of the original word is seen as 3D hologram from all the four sides

![image 5](https://github.com/sharvaree1921/Photos_for_repo/blob/master/WhatsApp%20Image%202020-12-20%20at%2011.15.50%20AM%20(1).jpeg)

![image 6](https://github.com/sharvaree1921/Photos_for_repo/blob/master/WhatsApp%20Image%202020-12-20%20at%2011.15.51%20AM.jpeg)

Method: Allign the input images as mirror images itself from all four sides

![image 7](https://github.com/sharvaree1921/Photos_for_repo/blob/master/WhatsApp%20Image%202020-12-20%20at%2011.29.49%20AM.jpeg)

observation: we see complete upright image now

![image 8](https://github.com/sharvaree1921/Photos_for_repo/blob/master/WhatsApp%20Image%202020-12-20%20at%2011.29.37%20AM.jpeg)

5] Refracrive Indices:
- RI of epoxy resin: 1.50 to 1.57
- RI of acrylic sheet: 1.4889
- RI of glass: 1.52

Direct observation has to be deduced, no conclusion can be made from numerical figures

6] Effect of monochrome/ RGB/ Black and white images:
- Irrespective of the color of image/texture of image, 3D hologram is seen as long as we keep it in appropriate manner

7] Effect of size:
- Increasing the input image size increases the 3D hologram size. In order to increase input image size:
  - Take larger screen
  - Magnify the image with some other lens/mirror prior to reflection from glass

8] Effect of Brightness:
- Incresing brightness of original input object increases the clarity of 3D hologram as the light source is more illuminated than usual.

20/12/2020

Questions:

1] Taking 4 different views of a single object and can the 3D hologram be seen?
2] Improvement required for the entire model

### Week 4: 20/12/2020 to 27/12/2020

#### [Competitive Analysis of different methods after implementation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10tLZQlaNRaU3DT-dX036Bn6QpYQSkeobzv1UwlABO8o/edit?usp=sharing)

![All methods](https://github.com/sharvaree1921/Photos_for_repo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202020-12-22%2020-23-40.png)

#### [All the photos for epoxy resin experiment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MA1DFaRJWMje8MAwpLCMn1QLM8kbAhp8hHpC4f_xl5U/edit)

**Observations:**
- Epoxy resin when filled in the glass or acrylic sheet gives almost same result. The difference in quality is not seen from the naked eyes
- Keeping cost(money as well as hands-on part required) in mind, acrylic sheet proves to be better than glass
- Clarity is drastically improved when we useepoxy resin
- Mirror image of original input image is seen as previous

**Analysis of 3D holograms when seen from different angles:**

| Angle | Image seen | clarity |
|---|---|---|
| w.r.t ground | fraction | (1-5): 5-very clear|
| 0 degrees| complete(1) | 5 |
| 30 degrees | 2/3rd | 5 |
| 60 degrees | 1/3rd | 5 |
| 90 degrees | none | - |

- When we increase the size of the pyramid, no significance difference is obsereved

**How do you make 3D object from pyramid**

![image85](https://github.com/sharvaree1921/Photos_for_repo/blob/master/WhatsApp%20Image%202020-12-27%20at%201.25.16%20AM.jpeg)

**Some Remarks**
- When 4 different side views are aligned in this manner then we can see the desired hologram
- The 3D hologram is indeed seen **3D** when looked from all the slides
- However, one is not able to the see the 3D feature when one moves from one side to another. Some gap/irregularity remains
- Mirror image thing still needs to be followed especially for 3D texts

_When we see from any one side of the pyramid, then it indeed seems 3D as if we are seeing the 3D movie without goggles.The depth is sensed clearly when we see the video/image_

[Epoxy resin 3D hologram implemented](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CSy1XNXusdnrG2n2zpQVnmlSMCsn5BJX/view?usp=sharing)

[3D holograms from Diffferent angles](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S78JQQnDXOk0vQnrLCvDR47sHnSp4Kqs/view?usp=sharing)

One thing to notice is that, black background gives the best results. If we use any other background say white, we will see that rectangular frame within it. Hence for viewing the particular object, we have to:
- Extract the object from background
- Take mirror image of all four sides of the object
- Align it in all the 4 directions as prescribed earlier

**Method to extract the object and make the required image**
- Decide the object you want to click photo of
- Take snapshots of that object from 4 sides(90 degrees to each other)
- Extract the object from background using _Adobe Illustrator_ software
- Use PicsArt or any other mobile app or photoshop to align these images in the form of mirror images onto the black background
- These applications provide accuracy in placing the extracted the object and placing them in the required background

_The hologram quality fades much in a light room. Dark room serves the best result_

- In order to see the complete hologram, moving somewhat backwards also suffices(1-2 meters depending upon the pyramid size)
- The distance to be moved backwards is inversely proportional to the size of pyramid

**Effect of daylight and dark room:**
- In day time, the 3D hologram is hardly(negligible) visible in case of epoxy resin
- In night time, 3D hologram is seen very clearly
- Comparison for different cases is done as follows:
  - ER means Epoxy resin.
  - Clarity(1: very poor, 5: very clear)

|   | Glass | Acrylic sheet|
|---| --- | --- |
| ER present & daytime | 1 | 1 |
| ER present & darkroom| 5 | 5 |
| ER absent & daytime | 2 | 1.5 |
| ER absent & darkroom| 3 | 2 |

**Remark:** If we use cone(infinite sided polygon(instead of pyramid), then exact continous nature can be obtained(ideal situation)). More the no. of faces, more the accuracy and continuity in 3D effects can be observed.

### Week 5: 27/12/2020 to 02/01/2021

**2 Objects not placed at center:**

![2 obj](https://github.com/sharvaree1921/Photos_for_repo/blob/master/2%20obj.jpg)

**Observations:**
- Extracted two objects are seen 3D but features such as shadow, light effect, sorrounding presenc, etc make them to not look 3D
- There is no change even if we don't keep them at center as long as they are properly aligned

Have a look at the video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yFVoulVpn9nw6bLcIgKWPyiVpCewHLL7/view?usp=sharing)

**3D Hologram Video procedure:**
- Place the desired object/ human in a room
- Video is made by successive frames of images by video editor app
- Since 4 cameras are not available, 4 snapshots from each side were taken. Hence, total 16 images were there
- After making the 4 videos for each side, Adobe Premier Pro software was used to align them as required

Have a look at the video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bu3jQQ-wOMm-9PDG_qkTumj637ptqVKk/view?usp=sharing)

Observations:
- As the video is made out of individual separate frames, desired continuity is not observed. But, if the videos are taken simultaneously from all four sides, the accuracy can be obtained 
- Discontinuity at 45 degrees is obtained as usual due to the pyramid shape
- 3D depth is seen when seen from one side
- Rest all observations hold true which are seen for the static image part(for pyramid and epoxy resin filled pyramid)
