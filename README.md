### 1. What are 3D Holograms?
A 3D hologram is defined as a 3D projection that exists freely in space and is visible to everyone without the need for 3D glasses. Holography is the next stage of photography and conventional film and its three-dimensionality creates completely new possibilities for use, such as for product presentation.

### 2. How 3D Holograms work?
Laser light is much purer than the ordinary light in a flashlight (torch) beam. In a flashlight beam, all the light waves are random and jumbled up. Light in a flashlight beam runs along any old how, like schoolchildren racing down a corridor when the bell goes for home time. But in a laser, the light waves are coherent: they all travel precisely in step, like soldiers marching on parade.

When a laser beam is split up to make a hologram, the light waves in the two parts of the beam are traveling in identical ways. When they recombine in the photographic plate, the object beam has traveled via a slightly different path and its light rays have been disturbed by reflecting off the outer surface of the object. Since the beams were originally joined together and perfectly in step, recombining the beams shows how the light rays in the object beam have been changed compared to the reference beam. In other words, by joining the two beams back together and comparing them, you can see how the object changes light rays falling onto it—and that's simply another way of saying "what the object looks like." This information is burned permanently into the photographic plate by the laser beams. So a hologram is effectively a permanent record of what something looks like seen from any angle.

Now this is the clever part. Every point in a hologram catches light waves that travel from every point in the object. That means wherever you look at a hologram you see exactly how light would have arrived at that point if you'd been looking at the real object. So, as you move your head around, the holographic image appears to change just as the image of a real object changes. And that's why holograms appear to be three-dimensional. Also, and this is really neat, if you break a hologram into tiny pieces, you can still see the entire object in any of the pieces: smash a glass hologram of a cup into bits and you can still see the entire cup in any of the bits!

[Using glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttv1Lo1Ld2o)

[Using CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMLHfqSEEjk)

Using CD case:

Materials:
1. Plastic CD case
2. Razor Blade
3. Electric Tape
4. Strongest Glue
5. Charcoal paper(for polishing edges)
5. Ruler, Pencil, A4 Paper, Smartphone

Precautions: Extra Careful while cutting the case.

**A2: [Pyramidal 3D hologram with epoxy resin(for greater clearity)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNceVquu02o)**

Extra Materials: Epoxy resin, hardener, weighing scale, beaker.

**Method_B: Smoke/Fog generated 3D Holograms**

**B1: [Smoke generated 3D Holograms by machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw9T-n_Ay5k)**

Smoke usually moves upward.Cheaper way to implement. Somewhat unstable.

1. Foam Insulated Project panels
2. Lot of Straws
3. Smoke Generation Machine
4. Table Top Fan
5. Corrugated Plastic Pipe
6. GLuing Gun
7. Professional Hardware Cutter
8. Projector

**B2: [Smoke generated 3D Holograms by icense sticks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-ePx_k--ho)**
1. Icense sticks
2. Mounted Alligned Cardboards

**Method_C: [3D Holograms Generated by Fast moving Fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-ePx_k--ho)**

**C1:[Regular fan with wooden pans having greater rpm motor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-ePx_k--ho)**

Either Readymade Fan or have to make one.
- _Readymade_: Might cost high
- _Homemade_: Have to buy motor,stand, wood, wood cutter,etc and high laborous work

**C2:[High tech Fan technology](https://unlimited.hamk.fi/uncategorized/holographic-fan-case-study/#.X8pa5sJS85l)**
RGB LED lights mounted on fan's panel and integrated with app for input of video

**Method_D: [3D Holograms using Liquid Nitrogen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-ePx_k--ho)**

1. Liquid Nitrogen
2. Pipe
3. Mirror
4. Projector

**Method_E: [Laser and Mirror Split film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTB2ryoWIFU)**

Highly sensitive method. Requires high accuracy and high-tech equipments.

**Method_F: [Mounting CD case at some angle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJ-QMOE2ps)**

## Prototyping Various Methods:

### Method A1] Pyramidal CD case/glass model:

Click here for [photos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MA1DFaRJWMje8MAwpLCMn1QLM8kbAhp8hHpC4f_xl5U/edit)

Video or short demo can be found [here](https://photos.google.com/direct/AF1QipN7hyMwt5H9zQnU16_XEbcTjZz88tUTHqZScBdRoxIZKa_lpV1tGXt1msKxOQqnJw/photo/AF1QipOIYdlCYoYWgIeAYKVuJ7e8jaavoP0S6e09bsT2)]

#### Observations:
1] Clarity is much better in glass than CD case or acrylic sheet
2] The base of the pyramid should be accurately flat and edges should be alligned properly to see proper interference pattern
3] Irrespective of sizes of pyramids, the size of Hologram is constant(Nearly 1/2 inch)
4] Size of 3D hologram is directly proportional to the original image/video (if some bigger screen is taken, then 3D hologram size also increases)
5] Best optimum size results found in middle sized glass hologram(comparing with the other models)

Some Remarks about Other methods:
1] Epoxy resin + Hardener order placed [here](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07MV9G6NC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - Resin: Hardener = 2:1 or 3:1
  - 'Super Clear transperant'/'High Definition Resin' required
  - proper weiging scale + beaker + stirrer required(still finding possible ways to perform this)
  
 2] Smoke generated 3D hologram with:
 A] Smoke generation machine(costs Rs.4000+ excluding other materials)
 B] Fogg/Water Vapour machine(costs 2000+ excluding other materials)
 C] Incense stick(in search of projector and good setup)
 
 3] Fast moving Fan technology
 Not possible at home, high end technology mentioned
 
 4] Liquid Nitrogen method(not sure:out of scope)
 
 5] Laser Mirror split(out of scope)
 
 6] Mounting CD case at some angle(2D hologram)
