# Virtual_3D_Presence_Systems
## Winter Intern 2020

### Week 1: 03/12/2020 to 06/12/2020
### 1. What are 3D Holograms?
A 3D hologram is defined as a 3D projection that exists freely in space and is visible to everyone without the need for 3D glasses. Holography is the next stage of photography and conventional film and its three-dimensionality creates completely new possibilities for use, such as for product presentation.

### 2. How 3D Holograms work?
Laser light is much purer than the ordinary light in a flashlight (torch) beam. In a flashlight beam, all the light waves are random and jumbled up. Light in a flashlight beam runs along any old how, like schoolchildren racing down a corridor when the bell goes for home time. But in a laser, the light waves are coherent: they all travel precisely in step, like soldiers marching on parade.

When a laser beam is split up to make a hologram, the light waves in the two parts of the beam are traveling in identical ways. When they recombine in the photographic plate, the object beam has traveled via a slightly different path and its light rays have been disturbed by reflecting off the outer surface of the object. Since the beams were originally joined together and perfectly in step, recombining the beams shows how the light rays in the object beam have been changed compared to the reference beam. In other words, by joining the two beams back together and comparing them, you can see how the object changes light rays falling onto it—and that's simply another way of saying "what the object looks like." This information is burned permanently into the photographic plate by the laser beams. So a hologram is effectively a permanent record of what something looks like seen from any angle.

Now this is the clever part. Every point in a hologram catches light waves that travel from every point in the object. That means wherever you look at a hologram you see exactly how light would have arrived at that point if you'd been looking at the real object. So, as you move your head around, the holographic image appears to change just as the image of a real object changes. And that's why holograms appear to be three-dimensional. Also, and this is really neat, if you break a hologram into tiny pieces, you can still see the entire object in any of the pieces: smash a glass hologram of a cup into bits and you can still see the entire cup in any of the bits!

### Week 2: 07/12/2020
## Prototyping Various Methods:

### Method A1] Pyramidal CD case/glass model:

Click here for [photos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MA1DFaRJWMje8MAwpLCMn1QLM8kbAhp8hHpC4f_xl5U/edit)

Video or short demo can be found [here](https://photos.google.com/direct/AF1QipN7hyMwt5H9zQnU16_XEbcTjZz88tUTHqZScBdRoxIZKa_lpV1tGXt1msKxOQqnJw/photo/AF1QipOIYdlCYoYWgIeAYKVuJ7e8jaavoP0S6e09bsT2)]

#### Observations:
1] Clarity is much better in glass than CD case or acrylic sheet
2] The base of the pyramid should be accurately flat and edges should be alligned properly to see proper interference pattern
3] Irrespective of sizes of pyramids, the size of Hologram is constant(Nearly 1/2 inch)
4] Size of 3D hologram is directly proportional to the original image/video (if some bigger screen is taken, then 3D hologram size also increases)
5] Best optimum size results found in middle sized glass hologram(comparing with the other models)

Some Remarks about Other methods:
1] Epoxy resin + Hardener order placed [here](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07MV9G6NC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - Resin: Hardener = 2:1 or 3:1
  - 'Super Clear transperant'/'High Definition Resin' required
  - proper weiging scale + beaker + stirrer required(still finding possible ways to perform this)
  
 2] Smoke generated 3D hologram with:

 A] Smoke generation machine(costs Rs.4000+ excluding other materials)
 B] Fogg/Water Vapour machine(costs 2000+ excluding other materials)
 C] Incense stick(in search of projector and good setup)
 
 3] Fast moving Fan technology
 Not possible at home, high end technology mentioned
 
 4] Liquid Nitrogen method(not sure:out of scope)
 
 5] Laser Mirror split(out of scope)
 
 6] Mounting CD case at some angle(2D hologram)

### Questions to be addressed:

1] Video played/image project: different or symmetrical?

2] how to make it clear(static assymmetrical image):

- Effect of HD/diff resolutions,
- Effect of monochrome/RGB/colour,
- Effect of brightness(%), 
- Effect of size,etc.
- (Take gradations: give ratings)

3] Environment changes(black room or light room): Day time

4] Refractive indices of glass, acrylic sheets, epoxy resin

5] What happens when we look 3D hologram from above? 

Next Stage:
Creating an image itself for symmetrical or assymmetrical objects

### Week 3: 13/12/2020 to 20/12/2020

#### Previous Experiments:

[video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kt-lUhhUJb1e8Q03nK3cxunmJ863DoL6/view?usp=sharing)

All photos regarding incense stick and steam generator machine are [here]()
_Hitachi LCD Projector was used for projection_

**Observations**
- The 3D hologram is very blur in both the cases. Hardly it can be seen.
- Comparitively, steam generated 3D hologram was more clearer than smoke generated 3D hologram
- Keeping black background benifitted in seeing the hologram more clearly than any other background
- In both the cases, entire clear hologram was visible. Only half of it was visible and that through only a particular angle
- We have to see straight in the line of projector in order to see it clearly
- Be very careful while dealing with incense sticks, they might be dangerous as we are lighting them all at once
- The entire setup is space and time taking
- Not at all cost efficient model with very poor quality

**Epoxy Resin Pyramid experiment still in progress**

**_Some Side remarks(experiences that i had while performing this experiment):_**
- Epoxy resin behaves entirely different when mixed _by volume_ and when mixed _by weight_.
- For this particular experiment, epoxy resin is to be used **by weight** and 3:1/2:1/1:1 any ratio would do(I used 3:1 ratio)
- The glass/acrylic sheet material pyramid has to be made accurately so that one can see the proper interference pattern otherwise the epoxy-resin solution may leak(unfortunately this happened with me inspite of using silicon and bond-tite hardware based special superglues)
- Be very careful while mixing solution. Prevent bubbles and yellowish texture from coming in the solution
- Epoxy resin takes 24 hours to dry, hence plan accordingly 

**Some Previous Questions that needed to be addressed along with some extra observations and conclusions that I made:**

#### For pyramid experiment:

1] Incresing the size of input object(i.e. images) increased the size of hologram.
- However, the size of the pyramid used also matters. Increase the size of pyramid in proportionate manner.
- The distnce of object from four sides is important to consider. More the distance, more far(greater in heights) is the hologram formed inside the pyramid.

2] What happens when we look hologram from above?
- The hologram is not at all seen from above. It is only seen from side views.

3] How can the 3D hologram be seen in daytime/ without using dark room?
- In order to see the clear 3D _reflection_ hologram in daytime, intense spot lights or illumination light is required like **Laser**. Basically we need 'directional' and coherent light source for clearer outputs. As we increase the background light as we move from dark room to illuminated room, more and more noise is added, which makes the rays coming from input images/objects less 'directional' and less ' single source illuminated'.
(Still researching on this topic for improvement of our model)

4] What's the nature of image/video frames when we project it?

**Static Image:**

The opposite images are placed in the 180 degrees flipped fashion in front of each other such that one end is diameterically opposite to the other at an equal distance.

The image can be symmetrical or assymetrical. It doesn't matter what our image is but it does matter how our images are placed on four sides.

Observation: Complete 3D hologram is seen as only a particular object is seen with black background.

![image 2](https://github.com/sharvaree1921/Photos_for_repo/blob/master/WhatsApp%20Image%202020-12-20%20at%2010.23.44%20AM.jpeg)

Observation: 3D Holographic frames from all 4 sides are seen as the images are rectangular in shape. No exact 3D object is seen in the middle.

When a single object with black bckground is kept:

Observation: The 3D object is clearly seen with mirror image of the original one

To see exactly, how it works, i took a word as our inout object

![image 4](https://github.com/sharvaree1921/Photos_for_repo/blob/master/WhatsApp%20Image%202020-12-20%20at%2010.52.38%20AM.jpeg)

Obseration: Mirror image of the original word is seen as 3D hologram
